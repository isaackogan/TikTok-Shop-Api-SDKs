    """ Get Campaign Group

     Get a campaign group's basic information, campaign period, sales period, and linked campaign groups.
    If the query succeeds without an available result, campaign_group is omitted and data is empty; no
    invalid ID is generated. Use ListCampaign to paginate and filter campaigns within the group.

    Requires SHOP authorization and shop_cipher. The shop, its seller, and its region are determined
    from the verified authorization context and cannot be supplied or overridden by the caller. Cross-
    shop access in the EU is limited to eligible shops belonging to the same seller and does not allow
    access to another seller's data.

    This is a query operation. It does not register for or withdraw from campaigns, sign agreements, or
    change campaign settings. Visibility, invitations, existing registrations, campaign status, and
    registration stage do not independently establish whether registration is currently allowed. An
    omitted eligibility result means unknown; it must not be interpreted as false, zero, free
    participation, an unlimited quota, or permission to register. Explicit false, zero, and empty arrays
    retain their meanings. Text is for display; automated decisions should use structured statuses and
    recognized reason codes.

    Invalid parameters, unknown request enum values, authorization failures, rate limits, and dependency
    failures use the platform's standard error mechanism. A known failure is not returned as a
    successful empty result. Campaign business processes determine status changes; this query does not
    change status or guarantee that every intermediate status occurs. Response enums may gain values in
    the future. Clients should preserve unknown values and handle them conservatively.

    Timestamps use RFC 3339 UTC with three fractional-second digits. See each field's description for
    interval boundaries and omission semantics. Statistics may be delayed or incomplete; no
    transactional snapshot is guaranteed across fields or pages. Query again before making a subsequent
    business decision.

    Use each campaign ID together with type: PRODUCT uses GetProductCampaign, SHOP uses GetShopCampaign,
    LIVESTREAM uses GetLivestreamCampaign, and SHORT_VIDEO uses GetShortVideoCampaign. Do not infer a
    detail endpoint for an unknown type.

    locale uses BCP-47 and defaults to en-US; en-GB uses English text. Text falls back according to the
    campaign's localization rules and may contain rich text; HTML sanitization is not guaranteed.
    Unavailable text is omitted rather than replaced with a placeholder name.

    Args:
        campaign_group_id (str):
        locale (str | Unset):

    Raises:
        errors.UnexpectedStatus: If the server returns an undocumented status code and Client.raise_on_unexpected_status is True.
